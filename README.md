# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
This election audit served two purposes, both of which revolved around creating a python script.  The first purpose was to analyze how votes were distributed between the counties of Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe.  The second purpose of this audit was to analyze how votes were distributed among the candidates and determine which candidate won the popular vote.

## Election-Audit Summary
The purpose of this challenge was to create a python script that could analyze vote distribution by county and by candidate and ultimately determine a winner.  With this script we were able to effectively perform an audit on an area of three counties which were represented by three candidates.  What this script has just performed is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of its capabilities and with enough time and resources, this script could be modified and used for any election.
